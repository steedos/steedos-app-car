## Features

- **Vehicle information management**: manage vehicle information (vehicle basic information, maintenance records, maintenance records, annual inspection records, insurance records, accident records, vehicle violation records, etc.); manage driver information (driver basic information, driver license information, etc.); manage vehicle use records (vehicle application records, vehicle scheduling records, expense reimbursement records, etc.)
- **Vehicle Approval Management**: customize the vehicle application process and vehicle expense reimbursement process according to the demand; after the process approval is completed, the vehicle application records and expense reimbursement records are automatically generated.
- **Milestone**: Milestone is usually set in the planning phase of a project and are updated as the project progresses. They are visual reference points, which can decompose the project into manageable and controllable phases to create orderly nodes to help project managers and teams anchor projects.
- **Query and Statistics**: Vehicle Administrators and managers can have different permissions to query vehicle information in different ranges, for example, they can query the expenses of vehicles with a given license number in a specific period of time; according to the demand, they can generate statistical reports, including expense statistics, repair statistics, maintenance statistics, etc.

## Requirements

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/) version >= 4.2. MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 10.15.1 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.
